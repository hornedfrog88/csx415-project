#### The purpose of this project is to take in a data set extracted from the UC Berkeley Student Information System (SIS), shape the data, generate features and develop a model to predict Total Course Enrollments. In this project we will train various models using a dataset of course/class enrollment information.  

#### The first step is to initialize the project. The COURSE_CAPACITY_DATA.csv file contains the raw course/class enrollment data extracted from UC Berkeley's Student Information System (SIS).  The data has been moved into the ./data folder of the project template and will be loaded into the environment.  All the necessary packages/libraries will be loaded based on what is specified in the the Config file.
```{r load project, include=FALSE}
